## This is a simple python calculator
It's nothing too special but it's just me trying to work with python and learning it along the way, maybe someone will enjoy it, I'll try to optimize it to the best of my abilities but for now it stays as console application. Maybe in the future I'll make it work with tkinter or simple python gui.

Features to add if i get inspiration:
    - different numerical systems i.e. binary, hex etc
